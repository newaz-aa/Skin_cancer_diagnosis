## Objective
* Classify the images into 7 different categories using CNN architecture
* Using transfer learning to improve performance
* Using data augmentation for better generalization
* Applying Explainable AI (XAI) tools such as Lime and SHAP for transparency
* Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to produce synthetic images

## Synopsis 
The 'skin_ham10000_v1.ipynb' notebook contains - 

* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Data Visualization
* Data preprocessing
* CNN architecture
* Model training, validation, and testing
